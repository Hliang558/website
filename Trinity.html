<h1>Trinity University</h1>

<a href="http:/trinity.edu">Trinity University</a> is located in San Antonio, Texas. (Continue here with more information about Trinity.)</p>
<div style="float:left; margin:0 10px 10px 10px;"><img src="csi-2.jpg"><br>Photo courtesy of Trinity University</div> </p> <p> I chose to attend Trinity University over other universities for the simple reason that Trinity's dedication to its students and their succesS is superior to other schools.Something super unique about Trinity is their Tiger Learning Center (TLC). This is a place where students can come in by appointment or walk in, to get help on essay writing or math from peer tutors.At the TLC, you can also meet with an academic coach. This is someone who can help you establish effective study strategies. Another way Trinity's dedicates its time and money into student success is by providing small sized classes and easily accessible professors. For almost every class you might take at Trinity, you will have the opportunity to establish and build a concrete relationship with your professor. You will have office hours to meet with professors for help on assignments or advice in general. I am confident that Trinity will provide me with the connections and opportunities I need to succeed. These are just two academic reasons that convinced me to come to Trinity.</p>
<p>Other features that convinced me to pick Trinity University is its gorgeous campus, small student body, and social awareness. I knew I wanted a school that was located in hot weather and was not overly big in size. So when my campus tour complete, I was already convinced that geographically this school was perfect for me. I also liked that the student body was averagely sized. About 650 students for each grade, quite similar to my high school. And lastly, I loved that Trinity had a Diversity and Inclusion Office. Because it is a quite recent building, it proved to me that Trinity was constantly evaluating its issues and working to solve them. At some point, Trinity must have felt the need to emphasize diversity & inclusion among students, which is why the office was created.</p></br>
<p>I hope to/ am thinking of majoring in Political Science and Accounting because my dream is to attend law school and receive my law license. I am particularly interested in business or tax law, which is why I decided to major in accounting as well. This way I could work toward my CPA license as well. Here are some links to important information about my chosen interest:
